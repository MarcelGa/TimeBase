# TimeBase Development Roadmap

## Overview

TimeBase is an open-source, modular time series data provider service for financial data. It follows a Home Assistant-inspired architecture with a central core managing pluggable data providers via Docker containers.

## Architecture Principles

- **Modular**: Pluggable provider architecture (like Home Assistant add-ons)
- **Bidirectional gRPC**: Efficient communication between core and providers
- **OHLCV + Extensions**: Standardized data format with optional metadata
- **Historical First**: Focus on historical data initially, real-time streaming later
- **Personal/Small Team Scale**: Optimized for personal use and small teams

## Technology Stack

- **Core**: .NET 10 (C#) with ASP.NET Core
- **Providers**: Python 3.11+ Docker containers
- **Communication**: gRPC (bidirectional streaming)
- **Database**: TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension)
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
